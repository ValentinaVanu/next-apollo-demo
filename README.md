# NEXT APPOLO CARD APP

## Welcome to my Card / Table 

I grabed the Data from GraphQL and shared it through my components.
At first sight **Card component** displays 20 cards with name and address.
**Table component** displays 20 rows of the mentioned date and Finally a Menu which allows us to click on **Load More** and will display 20 more rows everytime it's clicked, it also allows us to navigate through these two components.
